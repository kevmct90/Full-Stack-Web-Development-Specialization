        WE WILL LOOK AT
        var
        typeof

        DATA TYPES
        Number
        String
        Boolean
        Other e.g. Object
        

        NUMBER
        JavaScript has only one type of number
        Can be written with or without a decimal place
        Can use scientific notation
        var number1 = 34.289;
        var number2 = 100;
        var big_number = 123e5; //12300000
        var small_number = 123e5;
        //0.00123

        STRING
        A string simply means text
        You can use single or double quotes
        You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they
        don't match the quotes surrounding the string
        var name = "David";
        var title = 'Professor';
        var message = "It's alright";        

        BOOLEAN
        A Boolean value can only be true or false
        Do not confuse Boolean values with String values
        var condition1 = true;
        var condition2 = false;
        var myBool = true; //Boolean type
        var myString = "true"; //String type

        USING TYPEOF
        You can use the typeof operator
        to check the type of a variable

        COMMON CHANGES
        Code Quicker Typing
        count = count + 1 count++
        count = count ‐ 1 count‐‐
        count = count + 10 count += 10
        hello = hello + "!" hello += "!"
        marks = marks ‐ 20 marks ‐= 20
        pigs = pigs * 5 pigs *= 5
        cakes = cakes / students cakes /= students
