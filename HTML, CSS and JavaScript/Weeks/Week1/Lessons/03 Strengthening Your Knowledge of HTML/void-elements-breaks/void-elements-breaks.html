		All elements we have seen so far have this structure:
			<start_tag> . . . </end_tag>

		Some elements do not have any content. These are called 'void elements'. They must not use an end tag

		Example 
		<meta name = "author" content = "Kevin McTiernan">

		Some other void elements
		<img>
		<input> handling forms 

		handling breaks
		<br> break 
		<wbr> optional break  
		<hr> line break

		We will just investigate breaks now

My favourite word is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. It comes
from the movie 'Mary Poppins' and is hard to spell correctly.
