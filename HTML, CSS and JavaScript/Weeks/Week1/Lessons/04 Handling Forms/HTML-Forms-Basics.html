            SPAN
            Like div, span has no default style
            span is used for a few words

                BASIC FORM STRUCTURE
                <form action="destination" method="get or post">
                    . . . form elements go here . . .
                    <input type="submit">
                </form>

                DESTINATION
                action="destination" tells the browser
                what program to send the form data to e.g.:
                
                <form action="http://www.server.com/subdirectory/program.php">
                
                If the program is on same server as the html file:
                <form action="subdirectory/program.php">

                If the program in same directory as the html file:
                <form action="program.php">

                GET OR POST

                THE GET METHOD
                For a project you are developing, using get is a good idea. Seeing the form data in the URL is useful
                However, you cannot keep any secrets get can only handle a small transmission e.g. a few hundred letters/characters

                THE POST METHOD
                method="post"
                The main difference to get is you cannot see any data. Using post is better for keeping secrets
                post can handle a big transmission e.g. files
